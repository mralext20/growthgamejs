Introduction
  Growth is a game about growing using the environment around you.

Hunger
  Hunger can increase and decrease every time you do something.
  Once your hunger reaches 100, you die (losing all items), so make sure
  you eat when your hunger rises high!

Commands
  Growth is a game in which you type in commands using a keyboard.
  However there are only certain commands the game will understand.
  Some commands are global (can be used from anywhere), while some
  are specific to their locations, for example, you can only
  "relax" at home.

travel [location]
  Use this command to go somewhere. However it takes time to travel, and you
  get a bit hungry each time.

[action] [descriptors]
  Once somewhere initiate an action.
  Some actions take time. Some more than others.

stock
  Displays your stock (inventory). Displays all items you have and their amounts.

eat [item]
  Eats something from your inventory, lowering your hunger. How much hunger
  is lowered depends on what you are eating.

Saving and Loading your game
  You probably want to keep track of your progress, right?
  Use the `save' and `load' commands to save and load your save file.
  That easy! Take note that the save command will overwrite any `profile.json` file in the
  vicinity. Beware!
